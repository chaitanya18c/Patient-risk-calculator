# PATIENT RISK CALCULATOR
# Disease Prediction Model

This project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict diseases based on various patient attributes such as fever, cough, fatigue, and more. The dataset used includes symptoms, vital signs, and treatments provided for different diseases.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the type of disease based on patient symptoms and characteristics. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Dataset

The dataset contains patient information with the following attributes:
- Disease
- Fever
- Cough
- Fatigue
- Difficulty Breathing
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Outcome Variable
- Treatment

The dataset can be found in the `data/` folder as `diseases_with_treatment.csv`.
